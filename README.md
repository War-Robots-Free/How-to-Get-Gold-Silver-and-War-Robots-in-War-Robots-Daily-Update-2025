### **How to Earn Gold and Silver in War Robots: Tips for 2025**

1. **Participate in Daily Tasks and Events**
   The easiest way to earn both Gold and Silver is by completing **daily tasks** and participating in **events**. War Robots regularly updates the game with special time-limited events that reward players with Gold, Silver, and other valuable resources.

   - **Daily Tasks:** These are small objectives you can complete every day, and they usually give you Silver and other resources like **Repair Kits**, **Components**, or **Gold** as rewards. Keep an eye on these tasks to accumulate Silver steadily.
   - **Time-Limited Events:** War Robots frequently introduces special events where you can earn Gold by participating in **tournaments** or **challenges**. These events are often the best way to rack up Gold quickly.

2. **Complete Battles and Achievements**
   Winning battles is one of the most reliable ways to accumulate Silver. The more successful battles you engage in, the more Silver you will earn. Make sure to play actively to increase your overall Silver count.

   - **Achievement System:** War Robots also offers **achievements** for various milestones. By achieving these goals, you can unlock large amounts of **Gold** and **Silver**. This could range from winning a certain number of battles to unlocking specific robot types.
   - **Winning Ranked Matches:** Higher-ranked players often earn more Silver from ranked matches. If you can consistently win matches, youâ€™ll find that your Silver reserves grow exponentially.

3. **Join Alliances and Participate in Clan Wars**
   Joining an **Alliance** or **Clan** is another great way to earn Silver and Gold. Many alliances offer **Clan Wars**, which reward players with additional Gold or Silver based on their performance in these competitive events.

4. **Sell Unwanted Robots and Components**
   If you have **duplicate robots** or components that you no longer need, consider selling them for Silver. This is a great way to clear out your inventory while making a little extra currency on the side.

5. **Watch Ads and Complete Offers**
   Many players overlook this, but **watching ads** or **completing offers** in exchange for resources is an effective way to boost your Gold and Silver. In some cases, you can get Gold for free just by watching short video ads or completing certain offers. Always check the in-game store for available ads.

### **How to Get War Robots in 2025**

Robots are the backbone of **War Robots**, and getting the right robots can give you a huge advantage. While some robots can be bought using Silver, others require Gold or are only available through special events. Here's how you can get new War Robots in the game:

1. **Purchase Robots Using Silver**
   If you're looking to expand your arsenal with basic robots, **Silver** is your go-to currency. By earning Silver, you can buy a variety of robots, including:
   
   - **Early-Game Robots:** These are often the first robots youâ€™ll unlock and use. They are essential for getting started but may not have the firepower of higher-tier robots.
   - **Mid-Game Robots:** These robots have better abilities, weapons, and are often used in higher-level play.
   
   The key to unlocking powerful robots early on is to focus on maximizing your Silver earning potential. Participate in battles, complete events, and watch for opportunities to accumulate Silver.

2. **Purchase Robots Using Gold**
   Some of the most powerful robots in War Robots are **Gold-only** robots, which means youâ€™ll need Gold to acquire them. These robots often come with special abilities, weapons, and advantages that give you an edge in combat.

   - **Special Events:** From time to time, War Robots will introduce special events where you can unlock Gold-only robots. Participating in these events and winning will often earn you these robots for free or at a discounted price.
   - **Gold Offers:** Another way to get Gold robots is by spending real money to buy Gold or participating in in-game sales.

3. **Lucky Spins and Chests**
   **Lucky Spins** and **Event Chests** are ways to earn rare robots in War Robots. Occasionally, youâ€™ll find these chests filled with high-tier robots, weapons, and other valuable items. By spending Gold or opening chests with event rewards, you can get some of the rarest robots in the game.

   **Tip:** Check out the gameâ€™s latest promotions for the chance to get rare robots at a discounted rate or for free through special offers.

4. **Crafting and Upgrading Robots**
   In 2025, crafting robots is a more accessible feature in War Robots. You can now **craft robots** using a combination of Silver, Gold, and components. Crafting allows you to create powerful robots without directly purchasing them. Focus on gathering enough components through battles and events to craft the robot of your choice.

5. **Complete Special Missions**
   War Robots often updates the game with new missions or campaigns that allow players to earn unique rewards, including robots. By completing these missions, you may unlock powerful robots or earn the resources to craft them.
